					<h2>Why Teflon and Silicone?</h2>
					<p>Advanced Technology Supply only uses Teflon and&nbsp;Silicone Coated Fabrics&nbsp;for belt fabrication due to their advantageous properties.</p>
					<p>Silicone-coated fabrics are thin, flexible, durable, and paradoxically, dimensionally stable. The exact type of properties suited for belting. Silicone rubber is easily coated and can be cut to the exact specifications with our precision slitting machinery.</p>
					<p>Teflon is the perfect coasting for our clients in the food processing industry. We coat the conveyor belts in Teflon due to their anti-viral properties and resistance to heat.</p>
