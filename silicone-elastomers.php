					<h1 class="mb20">Silicone Rubber, Sponge, and Elastomers</h1>
					<p>Advanced Technology Supply, Inc. distributes, stocks, and fabricates many&nbsp;<strong>elastomeric/rubber materials.</strong> Commonly sold items include: silicone rubber sheets, silicone sponges, and foam, fluorosilicone sheet and sponge, urethane foam including Poron micro cellular, neoprene, nitrile, Viton, Ensolite, and others. Silicone is known for its durability, flexibility and low compression set in extreme heat or cold. This makes it ideal to be used for electrical insulation as sheets or tape, wire and cable coverings, extruded sleeving and moldings, coated glass-fiber cloths, and other multi-use tapes.</p>
					<h2>Silicone elastomers</h2>
					<p>These have many benefits over other elastomers</p>
					<ul>
					<li>Extreme Temperature Resistance for both high and low temperatures, ranging from +230&deg;C continuous to - 60&deg;C</li>
					<li>Non-toxic</li>
					<li>Tasteless</li>
					<li>Odorless</li>
					<li>Vast reduction in flammable components. If a fire was to take hold, the elastomer will turn to silica ash which is non-conductible</li>
					<li>Immense environmental resistance against all the elements and UV light</li>
					<li>Strong compression resistance at high temperatures making it perfect for sealing</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Silicone rubbers</h2>
					<p>Silicone rubber has a multitude of strong, mechanical properties and advanced capabilities. It is incredible durability gives it longevity which, in turn, earns it trust -- making it an extremely reliable and very popular material. Silicone rubber also offers great electrical insulation and like Silicone Elastomers, has very low flammable components due to its reactivity to chemicals. These qualities are what make silicone an excellent sealing material for a wide range of applications and industries.</p>
					<p>We fabricate these materials using <a href="/single-knife-slitting.php">single knife slitting</a>, <a href="/rotary-die-cutting.php">rotary die-cutting</a>, <a href="/steel-rule-die-cutting.php" >steel rule die cutting</a>, and laminate adhesive. We maintain an inventory of many of these materials for rapid turnaround. Most of the silicone materials can be provided with a standard acrylic or silicone pressure-sensitive adhesive. Additionally, we can provide many of these materials with a wide variety of PSAs that can be tailored to your requirements.</p>
